# Installation of AM32

It is much easier to just purchase ESCs that already have AM32 installed:

 * Repeat Robotics AM32 35A https://repeat-robotics.com/buy/am32/
 * Just Cuz Robotics Pariah 70A AM32 https://justcuzrobotics.com/products/pariah-70a-am32-weapon-esc
 * NeutronRC 70A with AM32 as an option https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804194450942.html
 * SEQURE 70A with AM32 https://www.amazon.com/SEQURE-Brushless-Electric-Controller-Airplanes/dp/B0CN6NB8CB/

(this list does not cover all the options on the market, just the ones I'm aware of)

If you want to install AM32 on your own, follow the instructions from https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware/wiki/Hacking-Guide
