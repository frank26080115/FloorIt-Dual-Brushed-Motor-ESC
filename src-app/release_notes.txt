# V0.1 Release Notes

This is a alpha release, features are all complete, but not fully tested.

## Test Coverage

 * Mathematic algorithms have all be verified:
   * voltage mixing
   * load balancing
   * tank-drive mixing
   * direct-PWM

 * Repeat Robotics Dual Brushless ESC
   * basic functionality with CRSF has been checked
   * sensors are working and the default calibration has been verified
   * current limiting passes simulation, have not attempted real world current limit test

 * EMAX Formula 45A ESC
   * basic functionality with CRSF has been checked
   * there are no sensors on this ESC

 * Repeat Robotics AM32 Drive ESC 35A
   * basic functionality with CRSF has been checked
   * basic functionality with RC PWM input has been checked
   * voltage sensor verified
   * there is no current senseor on thiS ESC

 * NeutronRC 70A
   * basic functionality with CRSF has been checked
   * basic functionality with RC PWM input has been checked
